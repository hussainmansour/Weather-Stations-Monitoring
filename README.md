## Executive Summary

We designed and implemented a scalable, fault-tolerant weather monitoring system that ingests real-time data from 10 simulated stations into Apache Kafka, processes streams for high-humidity events, archives data to Parquet files, maintains a BitCask-based key-value store for low-latency access, and indexes historical data in Elasticsearch for visualization in Kibana.

## System Architecture
![System Architecture Diagram](architecture.png "Architecture Overview")


1. **Data Acquisition**: Java-based producers emit Avro messages every second to the `weather_readings` Kafka topic.
2. **Stream Processing**: Kafka Streams application detects humidity >70% and routes alerts to the `rain_alerts` topic.
3. **Storage Layers**:

   * **BitCask** key-value store for latest station status.
   * **Parquet** files for append-only archival, partitioned by station ID and timestamp.
4. **Indexing & Visualization**: Elasticsearch ingests Parquet files; Kibana dashboards visualize battery distribution and dropped-message metrics.
5. **Deployment & Observability**: Docker containers on Kubernetes; profiling with Java Flight Recorder.

## Implementation

### A. Weather Station Mock

* Java producers simulate 10 stations, emitting Avro records every second.
* Randomized battery statuses (30% low, 40% medium, 30% high) and 10% message drop rate.

### B. Kafka Integration

* Avro serialization and Confluent Schema Registry for type safety, compact messages, and compatibility.

### C. Raining Triggers via Kafka Streams

* Streams application filters humidity >70% and publishes to `rain_alerts` topic.
* Custom exception handlers ensure robust error handling.

### D. Central Station & BitCask

* **BitCask**: log-structured design with in-memory hash index for O(1) reads.
* Periodic compaction and file rotation at 50 MB threshold.
* Client API supports bulk and key-specific reads.

### E. Parquet Archiving

* Batch writes of 10,000 records per file using Apache Parquet.
* Directory layout: `/data/parquet/{station_id}/{timestamp}.parquet`.

### F. Elasticsearch & Kibana Indexing

* Spark job flattens Parquet files and converts to Elasticsearch NDJSON.
* Watchdog filesystem watcher ensures new files are indexed and moved to `processed/` or `failed/`.
* Kibana visualizations:

  * Battery Status Distribution
  * Dropped Messages Percentage

### G. Kubernetes Deployment

* Docker images and Kubernetes manifests for:

  * `weather-station` (10 replicas)
  * `central-station`, `kafka`, `elasticsearch`, `kibana` services
* PersistentVolumes for logs, Parquet data, and BitCask store.

### H. Profiling with Java Flight Recorder

* 1-minute profiling under peak load.
* GC pause analysis, memory consumption, file I/O metrics.

## Results & Validation

* **Battery Status**: 28.81% low, 40.61% medium, 30.57% high.
* **Dropped Messages**: Average 9.04% per station.

## Bonus Integrations

* **Enterprise Integration Patterns**: Publish–Subscribe, Dead-Letter, Polling Consumer, Idempotent Receiver, Content-Based Router.
* **Avro Schema** example between stations and central.
